# 3DS and assoicated inventory
## Settings
The 3DS is hooked into my old nintendo network ID, so that you can play Links awakening. Should this prove problematic, you'll have to format the device. I will tell you the passcode.
## Games
#### Different cartridge types
The 3DS supports both 3DS cartriages and DS cartriages. I also purchased several online games and downloaded them. The type of cartriage will be listed along with the game.
### List
- Doodle jump adventures, 3DS cartridge (features full length campaign)
- Rhythm Heaven, DS cartridge (Honestly soundtrack isn't half bad)
- Art Academy, 3DS cartridge (learn how to draw with a 3ds stylus)
- Club Penguin Herbert's Revenge, DS cartridge (dunno never played this one)
- Pokemon Black, DS cartridge (awesome game)
- Pokemon White, DS cartridge (dunno never played this one either)
- Mariokart 7, 3DS cartridge (better than mariokart 8 delux)
- Links awakening, digital licence (awesome, best zelda game out of the 3 ive played)
